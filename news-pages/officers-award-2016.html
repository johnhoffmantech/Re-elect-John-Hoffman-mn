            and Peace Officers Association</p>

        <p><strong>Sen. Hoffman named Legislator of the Year by Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association (MPPOA)</strong></p><p>
            ST. PAUL, Minn – Citing his dedication to the safety of Minnesota police officers and other emergency
            personnel, the
            MPPOA honored Sen. John Hoffman (DFL-Champlin) this week with its 2016 Legislator of the Year award.
            “Senator Hoffman understands the challenges police officers face on a daily basis. He has a keen
            understanding of the
            importance of public safety and the association recognizes his concrete efforts in helping law enforcement
            to provide for
            the safety of our communities and the protection of our members” stated Minnesota Police and Peace Officers
            Executive
            Director, Dennis Flaherty.</p>
        <p>Senator Hoffman was the chief author of legislation this session designed to assist peace officers and other
            emergency
            personnel should they obtain significant exposure to bodily fluids while on duty and thus, face the risk of
            infection. There
            has been long standing protocol in state law that dictates how hospitals must deal with emergency workers
            who face
            infection risk from blood borne pathogens, but the law had not addressed these same concerns for police and
            emergency
            personnel until this year. Flaherty said Hoffman’s legislation will allow a court to order an individual to
            submit blood for
            testing.</p>
        <p>“I’m very honored to receive this award from MPPOA. Law enforcement officers put themselves in harm’s way
            every day
            in order to keep their communities safe. Ensuring they are protected when members of the public may have
            infected them
            with a serious disease is the least we can do. It’s been great working with MPPOA this past session on this
            legislation, and
            I look forward to doing more good work with them in the future,” said Sen. Hoffman.</p>
        <p>
            Hoffman also co-sponsored legislation this session clarifying the statute of fourth degree assault against a
            peace officer,
            which provides enhanced penalties for physically assaulting a police officer or for intentionally throwing
            or otherwise
            transferring bodily fluids or feces at or onto the police officer. Both of Hoffman’s provisions were signed
            into law by
            Governor Mark Dayton.</p>
