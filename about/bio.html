        <img class="mb-4" src="../content/gallery/John-leading-formal.jpg">

        <p>
            Throughout my career, I have been afforded many opportunities to assume progressive management roles, which
            have allowed me to gain and implement a unique set of expertise. With more than 25 years’ successful
            experience in business, education, facilitation, and legislation across various industries as well as Local,
            State, and Federal I have developed a proven record of dedicated leadership. My professional experiences
            have also presented me with many opportunities to join forces with other community, local, state and
            National leaders to develop impactful and tactical strategies and solutions for individuals, groups, and the
            community at large.
        </p>


        <p>


            As a <a href="https://www.dfl.org/localunit/sd36/" target="blank">State Senator</a> of the great State of
            Minnesota, I practice and participate in the delivery of
            executive-level leadership to contribute to policy infrastructure initiatives at the Local, State, and
            National levels of government. I also hold an extensive background in educational program development,
            credit counseling services, and support services for individuals and families with special healthcare needs.
        </p>



        <p>The following accomplishments demonstrate the value of my contributions:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Recognized efforts for recommending workforce alternatives for individuals with disabilities.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Successfully developed protocols and programs across academic and business organizations.
                </li>

                <li>Recommended, implemented and executed policy change programs to assist in community development
                    initiatives.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>



        <p>To promote further leveraging of my existing competencies, I am asking you to support me as your Senator.
            This role allows me to demonstrate my talents in consultation, project management, and policy development.
            It would also provide an opportunity to continue to gain, apply, and share my knowledge with others. An
            organization that values advanced experience, strategic thinking, and team work would be ideal for
            establishing a long-term professional relationship and extending my current abilities.

        </p>


        <p class="mb-4">There are two constituencies that we need to assure we operate in a collective and transparent way. The
            first, Minnesotans who are needing the servant leadership in order to get to self productive lives and to
            support those who are most vulnerable. 1 in 5 people in Minnesota live with a disability 1 in 10 have a
            chronic disability. They deserve leadership that is compassionate and can make the connections. The second
            constituency is the tax payer and deserve the attention to know that their investment for the betterment of
            people in Minnesota is done in a fiscally vigilant manner. For every dollar we put on the table, the federal
            government matches. We can do better and I have ideas on how to get that in place.</p>
