        <h3>Sen. Hoffman named Legislator of the Year by Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association (MPPOA)</h3>
        <p>
            ST. PAUL, Minn– Citing his dedication to the safety of Minnesota police officers and other emergency
            personnel, the MPPOA honored Sen. John Hoffman (DFL-Champlin) this week with its 2016 Legislator of the Year
            award.
        </p>

        <p> “Senator Hoffman understands the challenges police officers face on a daily basis. He has a keen
            understanding of the importance of public safety and the association recognizes his concrete efforts in
            helping law
            enforcement to provide for the safety of our communities and the protection of our members” stated Minnesota
            Police and Peace Officers Executive Director, Dennis Flaherty.</p>

        <p>
            Senator Hoffman was the chief author of legislation this session designed to assist peace officers and other
            emergency personnel should they obtain significant exposure to bodily fluids while on duty and thus, face
            the risk of infection. There has been long standing protocol in state law that dictates how hospitals must
            deal with emergency workers who face infection risk from blood borne pathogens, but the law had not
            addressed these same concerns for police and emergency personnel until this year. Flaherty said Hoffman’s
            legislation will allow a court to order an individual to submit blood for testing.
        </p>

        <blockquote id="education-quote">
            <p>
                “I’m very honored to receive this award from MPPOA. Law enforcement officers put themselves in harm’s
                way
                every day in order to keep their communities safe. Ensuring they are protected when members of the
                public
                may have infected them with a serious disease is the least we can do. It’s been great working with MPPOA
                this past session on this legislation, and I look forward to doing more good work with them in the
                future,”
                said Sen. Hoffman.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Hoffman also co-sponsored legislation this session clarifying the statute of fourth degree assault against a
            peace officer, which provides enhanced penalties for physically assaulting a police officer or for
            intentionally throwing or otherwise transferring bodily fluids or feces at or onto the police officer. Both
            of Hoffman’s provisions were signed into law by Governor Mark Dayton.

            The
            bill Sen. Hoffman passed allows the County to levy for the cost instead. By paying cash, the County – and
            its taxpayers – will save an estimated $600,000 in interest payments over the years.

        <h3>Crime and Guns</h3>

        <p>
            <strong>Drug sentencing reform</strong><br>

            The drug sentencing bill represents a compromise of various groups and is the first overhaul of our drug
            sentencing laws in years. In short, the law now treats drug dealers as dealers, and addicts as addicts.
            Those who are high-level drug dealers who bring poison and violence into our communities will be going to
            prison for a longer time, and those who are stuck in the cycle of addiction will be able to get the help
            they need in kicking their habit.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hoffman supported the first overhaul of our drug sentencing laws in years. Instead of ignoring the
                underlying issues of addictions and incarcerating nonviolent addicts, Minnesota will emphasize medical
                support for individuals addicted to drugs by investing in chemical dependency treatment. This treatment
                is coupled with harsher penalties on dangerous drug dealers. With fewer drug dealers on the street and
                fewer people addicted to drugs, Minnesota’s communities will be safer. (Drug sentencing reform, <a

            <strong>Police body cameras</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            This bill regulates the use of body cameras worn by peace officers, and classifies the data generated by the
            cameras. Body camera data is private data on individuals or nonpublic data, unless certain criteria are met.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Hoffman supported a body camera regulation bill desired by both law enforcement agencies and community
                members.</li>
            <li>The body camera regulations that were passed provide a process by which members of the public can access
                body camera footage if they are concerned about a particular encounter with police, but also protects
                the privacy of crime victims, medical patients, and other vulnerable people who may find themselves in
                embarrassing or compromising situations, often through no fault of their own. (Police body cameras, <a

        <h3>State Government</h3>
        <p><strong>Military and Veterans Funding</strong></p>
        <p>Sen. Hoffman has supported millions of dollars in benefits to active military members, veterans, and their
            families since 2013.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hoffman voted for $8.7 million in additional funding for veterans in 2013, which included a doubling of
                financial resources for county veterans service officers (CVSOs), who are the first point of contact for
                veterans seeking assistance. (2013 Omnibus State Government Bill Conference Report, 5/20/13, <a

        <h3>Bill helps streamline driver’s license process for Minnesota veterans</h3>
        <p>The frustrating and unfair experience of one of Sen. John Hoffman’s (DFL-Champlin) constituents served as
            inspiration for a bill that allows active duty members of the military to retake driver’s license tests
            without adhering to the mandatory practice period under Minnesota law. The bill, which was passed
            unanimously on the Senate floor Monday, streamlines the process for active duty military personnel to
            re-take either the skills or road test portion of the driver’s license test. Sen. Hoffman says it was the
            personal story of Douglas Washington — a young active duty member of the Navy who inspired him to chief
            author the bill.</p>
        <p>“We need to make sure our active duty military are given the respect they deserve by being flexible in not
            only how we provide services to them but when. Members of the military frequently receive little warning
            before they must be report for duty in another state or country. This uncertainness can really hinder their
            ability to take and pass a skills or road driver’s license test if they didn’t pass the first time. My
            constituent Douglas’ had a really bad experience and ended up having to report for duty before he
            successfully passed his driver’s test. His experience is something that should never happen to any of our
            active military personnel,” said Sen. Hoffman.</p>
        <p>Minnesota law currently states, when an individual fails a skills or road driver’s license test there is a
            mandatory waiting period before the individual may retake the test. This bill would exempt active duty
            military personnel from this waiting period. In order to retake the test, the individual must present
            documentation proving they are active duty military personnel.</p>

        <p><strong>Women’s Economic Security Act (WESA)</strong></p>
        <p>Hoffman voted for the Women’s Economic Security Act (WESA), which provides workplace protections for women,
            funds grants to women-owned businesses, allows employed mothers more time with their children, and ensures
            victims of assault receive the care they need. (WESA, 5/8/14, <a
                href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?f=HF2536&y=2014&ssn=0&b=house" target="blank">H.F.
                2536</a>)</p>

        <h3>Pensions</h3>
        <p><strong>Public Pension Management</strong></p>

        <p>Minnesota continues to have a strong pension system, with only 2% of Minnesota state and local government
            spending on public pensions, which is the sixth lowest ratio in the country and just half the national
            average of 4.1% as a percentage of total direct general spending. State aid increases for public pension
            plans in 2013 and 2014 were accompanied by increased contributions required from public employees and
            employers into the plans, so that pension liabilities are a shared sacrifice.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Hoffman supported increased pension contributions from public employees to ensure public pension plans
                remain adequately funded and employees contribute a sufficient amount to their pensions. These increased
                contributions protect retirees and ensure pension disbursements do not exceed assets. (2013 Omnibus

            <li>Hoffman voted in favor of reducing state aid to the Public Employee Retirement Association (PERA) for
                the previous merger of the Minneapolis Employee Retirement Fund, which saves $36 million per biennium.
