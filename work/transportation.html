        <p>Sen. Hoffman has been a leader in funding smart, cost-effective transportation projects. Among his many
            achievements as a state senator has been to secure funding for the expansion of Hwy. 610. In 2013, our
            region received an incredible <strong>$80 million</strong> from the newly formed Corridors of Commerce program to begin
            <strong>extensive road construction on Highway 610</strong>. These investments are vitally important to our corner of the
            metro, making us more attractive to new businesses which bring good paying jobs and add to our tax base. The
            new highway corridor will support continued economic growth and job creation in the northwest Twin Cities
            suburbs. The 2.5-mile extension will open to traffic in late 2016.</p>

        <p>Sen. Hoffman’s steadfast support for the expansion of Hwy. 610 has also paved the way for local business
            growth:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The state recently completed a <a href="http://www.dot.state.mn.us/metro/projects/610/" target="blank">three-mile stretch of improvements</a> on Hwy 610 between Brooklyn Park and
                Maple Grove that included three overpasses, noise walls and a pedestrian bridge. Gov. Mark Dayton
                recently announced plans to complete a connection on Hwy. 610 between Interstate 94 and County Rd. 81.
                <strong>The road improvements are among the drivers for a flurry of new construction in the area</strong>.
            </li>
            <li> Olympus spokeswoman Laura Steele called <a href="https://finance-commerce.com/2013/12/quick-action-tips-scales-for-brooklyn-park/#ixzz3zsRUbKka" target="blank">the expansion project</a>, “<strong>A No. 1 factor is convenience for our
            existing employees</strong>.” </li>
            <li>Target Corporation significantly expanded its Brooklyn Park offices, and Sen. Hoffman’s support of the
                expansion of Hwy. 610 helped facilitate this expansion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Transportation</h3>
        <p><strong>Transportation Funding Votes</strong></p>
        <p>Sen. Hoffman voted against H.F. 1444 (<a href="https://www.senate.mn//journals/2013-2014/20130510054.pdf#page=3570" target="blank">p. 3570</a>) in 2013, third reading, The Omnibus Transportation and Public
            Safety bill, which contained numerous tax increases. These tax increases include a 5 cent gas tax increase
            which was projected to raise millions in new revenue, increasing the motor vehicle sales tax, adding ¾ cent
            to the five county transit sales tax, and allowing all counties to implement a wheelage tax.</p>
        <p>He also voted against a similar bill, H.F. 4 (<a href="https://www.senate.mn//journals/2015-2016/20150427048.pdf#page=8" target="blank">p. 2912</a>) in 2015. This bill also included the gross receipts
            tax (about a 16 cent a gallon increase at $2.50/gallon), a ¾ cent increase in the seven county metro transit
            sales tax, increases in tab fees and vehicle registration taxes, and this bill included the “Driver’s
            License For All” provision mentioned above.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hoffman protected all Minnesotans and our business community against an unnecessary gas tax and
                registration fee increases. This additional cost will be passed on to consumers and impact those who
                earn the least, the hardest.
            </li>
            <li>This tax could have costed Minnesota taxpayers almost $2 billion a year, and this was supported by the
                DFL despite a $900 million surplus.</li>
            <li>Hoffman saved his community from seeing a gas tax increase of 50% compared to what the working families
                of Minnesota pay today.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>2014 Omnibus Supplemental Appropriations Bill</strong></p>
        <p>This was the omnibus supplemental bill in 2014, >H.F. 3172 (<a href="https://www.senate.mn//journals/2013-2014/20140516106.pdf#page=727" target="blank">p. 10395</a>). There was a $13 million target agreed
            upon. The transportation article included $6.5 million for Greater Minnesota Transit, increased rail
            inspectors, rail grade crossing safety improvement funds, increases in MnDOT efficiencies, oil and hazardous
            materials safety improvements, and others.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hoffman voted to increase safety along rail lines that transport oil and hazardous material by
                authorizing additional railroad track and vehicle inspectors, adding safety requirements, safety
                trainings, and sharing emergency management preparedness plans with emergency response agencies.
            </li>
            <li>In addition to safety provisions, this bill requires MnDOT to increase efficiencies by at least 5%.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-uppercase"><strong>Real ID</strong></p>
        <p>Sen. Hoffman voted for both REAL ID bills in the session. The first bill, S.F. 1646 (<a href="https://www.senate.mn//journals/2015-2016/20160330075.pdf#page=2" target="blank">p. 5330</a>) allowed the
            Department of Public Safety (DPS) to report back to the legislature about what needed to be done to
            implement the federal driver’s license and ID requirements. The second bill, S.F. 3589 (<a href="https://www.senate.mn//journals/2015-2016/20160512098.pdf#page=7" target="blank">p.7011</a>), would have
            allowed DPS to begin to implement REAL ID standards. However, this bill failed in conference committee as
            the House and Senate could not agree on bill language. The bill negotiations stalled on a single provision.
            The House GOP was worried the second tier, Minnesota driving-only license, would allow DPS to use its
            rulemaking authority to allow undocumented immigrants to obtain driver’s licenses. However, DPS currently
            has this authority and undocumented immigrants do not have driver’s licenses.</p>

        <p><strong>The next deadline for REAL ID is not until 2018. So, Minnesotans still have time to come into
                compliance.</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hoffman voted in support of a balanced solution allowing those who want to fly the option of getting a
                REAL ID-compliant license or ID and continue to board airplanes as normal, but also allowed for those
                worried about personal privacy to obtain a driving-only license.
            </li>
            <li>Hoffman supported a commonsense solution that would have brought Minnesota into compliance with REAL ID
                standards at a minimal public cost while also allowing for the privacy of concerned individuals.</li>
        </ul>
