        <p>
            Before Sen. Hoffman was elected to the state legislature, Minnesota’s unemployment rate was 5.7 percent;
            today, after nearly four years in the Minnesota Senate, that unemployment rate has dropped to 3.5 percent,
            among the lowest rates in the nation. One of the key elements to Sen. Hoffman’s work in the legislature has
            been his support for investment in job training. Here are a few of the many success stories resulting from
            these investments:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Anoka-Ramsey Community College received two separate job training grants from DEED to help train
                    employees
                    at Faribault Food and Aspen Equipment Co. Anoka-Ramsey received $300,000 to develop training for
                    about 302
                    technical operators and maintenance mechanics at Faribault Foods, which has manufacturing sites
                    located in
                    three Minnesota towns.
                </li>
                <li> Anoka-Ramsey was also awarded $271,310 to help Aspen Equipment Co. develop and deliver a
                    comprehensive training program for around 125 employees – 15 of which are new. The technical
                    training provided by
                    the college will qualify the trainees for a number of certifications and will help Aspen Equipment
                    maintain quality and improve productivity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Design Ready Controls in Brooklyn Park recently received nearly $92,000 in Pipeline Dual Training
                    Grant money to train employees at the control panel solutions company.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Budget and Taxes</h3>
        <p>
        <strong>Budget Reserves</strong><br>

            Since 2001, the budget reserve account had been statutorily capped at a maximum dollar level of $653
            million. Under the new law (2014), the commissioner of MMB specifies the percentage following an annual
            evaluation. Additionally, legislation created a new, automatic mechanism that transfers 33 percent of future
            November forecast balances until the target is reached.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Hoffman voted to make saving a priority above spending. This is a result of a portion of the surplus
                    being
                    dedicated before the Legislature is able to spend it. This money will be used to cushion the state
                    when it
                    faces a future recession. (HF 1777–2014, 3/26/2014)
                </li>

        <p>
            
            <br><strong>Income tax fairness for 98% of Minnesotans</strong><br>

            In 2013, Democrats did the hard work and accomplished what hadn’t been done in decades: finally delivering
            fairness to the tax system for middle-class Minnesota families. By voting for fair income taxes on the top
            2% of earners, Sen. Hoffman helped reduced the gap that was allowing the wealthiest in our state to pay less
            of their income in taxes than everyone else.<br><br>

            <strong>Cracking down on corporate tax evasion</strong><br>

            Sen. Hoffman voted to close more than $400 million in tax loopholes used by big corporations to avoid paying
            Minnesota income taxes. By cracking down on tax cheats, we raised money to help deliver millions of dollars
            in economic development in every corner of our state and raise responsible, stable revenue to balance the
            budget for the first time since 2002.<br><br>

            <strong>The first property tax decrease in more than a decade</strong><br>

            Sen. Hoffman supported more than $500 million in property tax relief from 2013-2016. In 2014, average
            statewide property taxes in Minnesota decreased for the first time since 2002. His votes also provided
            property tax refund increases to homeowners, renters, senior citizens and farmers across the state.

            <ul>
                <li> In 2014 alone, at least 167,000 additional Minnesotans were expected to receive property tax
                    refunds (137,000 homeowners and 30,000 renters) and statewide property taxes were expected to decrease by
                    $121 million in 2014, the first decrease in a decade (non-partisan Department of Revenue analysis
                    released July
                    2013).
                </li>
            </ul>

        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Lowering business property taxes</strong><br>

        Sen. Hoffman voted for the 2015 tax bill that included a $69 million reduction in the statewide business
        property tax. He also voted for the 2016 tax bills that included additional reductions in the statewide
        business property tax, including a total exemption for Minnesota’s small businesses.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Eliminating the marriage penalty</strong><br>

        Sen. Hoffman voted for the 2014 federal conformity bill, which eliminated the “marriage penalty” that cost
        many married couples more money on income taxes each year. Because Minnesota hadn’t conformed to the federal
        standard deduction for married filers since 2011, married couples had to add back an increasing amount of
        taxable income for Minnesota tax purposes each year — $2,050 in 2013. This bill eliminated that gap
        beginning with Tax Year 2014.

        This change was estimated to save 653,072 married Minnesotans an average $115 in taxes; 541,069 of those
        couples have income under $100,000.

        <p>
            <strong>Reinstating LGA for his cities – and lowering property taxes</strong><br>
        

        Brooklyn Park, Coon Rapids and Champlin received $0 in Local Government Aid prior to 2013. They were some of
        the inner-ring suburbs mostly cut off from the LGA formula around 2004. In 2013, the DFL passed an $80
        million statewide LGA increase that included significant, bipartisan-supported LGA formula reform in the
        final tax bill. Sen. Hoffman ultimately supported this bill, which brought his three cities back onto the
        LGA formula and delivered state money to help control local property taxes. Because of his efforts, his
        cities received the following LGA from 2013-2016:

        <ul>
            <li>Brooklyn Park: $3.35 million</li>
            <li>Coon Rapids: $3.12 million</li>
            <li>Champlin: $700,000</li>
        </ul>
