            As a father and former Vice Chair of the Board of Directors of the Anoka-Hennepin School District, Sen.
            Hoffman
            sees E-12 education as a critical trust, and he supports efforts to provide the best possible education for
            our
            children. He has, during the past three years:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Fought for, and secured, $10 million in Compensatory pilot grants for five school districts
                    including Osseo
                    and Anoka-Hennepin. This is a proven program that has seen success in closing the achievement gap by
                    targeting funds at those who need it the most.</li>
                <li>Supported, and voted for, all-day kindergarten for every school district in the state.</li>
                <li>
                    Expanded early-learning investments, which last year included:
                    <ul>
                        <li>$30.75 million in School Readiness, which helps prepare our youngest learners for
                            kindergarten.</li>
                        <li>$48.25 million for Early Learning Scholarships, which are targeted at Minnesotans who are
                            most in need.</li>
                        <li>$10 million to help eliminate the Head Start waiting list. There is a long waiting list for
                            low-income
                            Minnesota families to get their children into critical Head Start programs. This waiting
                            list has been eliminated
                            meaning no more kids will fall through the cracks and be forced to wait to begin their
                            education.</li>

                                colleagues – 3,300 four-year-olds will have a better opportunity to succeed in school this fall. This week

                                session. Both of Sen. Hoffman’s school districts are receiving funds; the grant size and the number of

                                    additional funding had been available – we could have made this opportunity available to the 10,139 kids

                                        “We’ve had some success in closing the achievement gap over the past few years by using school
                                        readiness dollars to pay for pre-K programming. We’re experiencing around 90 percent of students who
                                        go through our pre-K program as ready for kindergarten – and these are high-risk kids. With this
                                        newest round of grant funding, we are hoping to build on that success and see more of our kids

                                “Expanding access to pre-kindergarten has been one of our school district’s goals for several years. This
                                state-funded option will dramatically accelerate our work, allowing more than 200 additional students to
                                experience high quality pre-kindergarten programming. It will also help those students be prepared for
                                kindergarten and on track to read at grade level by grade three – which are two of the state’s World’s Best
                                Workforce goals,” said Dr. Kate Maquire, superintendent of Osseo Area Schools.<br><br>
                    
                                According to the Department of Education, 183 school districts and charter schools applied for
                                pre-kindergarten funding this year. Due to lack of funds available, nearly 60 percent of those districts did
                                not receive state aid.<br><br>
                    
                                For years, Minnesota has faced persistent achievement gaps. Studies have shown that early learning programs
                                have impressive and long-lasting benefits for low-income students, including increased high school
                                graduation and employment rates, and decreased incarceration rates. Leading researchers and economists have
                                found that these outcomes yield long-term benefits of as much as $16 for every $1 invested in early learning
                                programs.<br><br>

                            ST. PAUL, Minn. – What began as a state-run pilot project a decade ago has grown into a system that Sen.
                            John Hoffman (DFL-Champlin, Brooklyn Park and Coon Rapids) argues can help close the state’s achievement
                            gap. Sen. Hoffman is chief author of a bill that invests $14 million per biennium into compensatory funding
                            revenue, which is given to school districts based on their percentage of students on the free or reduced
                            lunch program. The bill also makes the funding program permanent, currently it requires reauthorization
                            every two years. The additional revenue is used by districts to help increase students achievement and test
                            scores.<br><br>
                
                            Hoffman says his bill, which received its first hearing in the Senate E-12 Finance Committee on Thursday, is
                            about bringing equity to school districts and helping students succeed.<br><br>
                
                            “We know compensatory funding works, it gives school districts with a higher proportion of kids receiving
                            free or reduced lunch – a needed boost. By targeting money to districts that need it most to help these
                            struggling students meet performance standards, we are slowly, but steadily closing the achievement gap and
                            building the world’s best workforce,” said Hoffman.<br><br>
                
                            Hoffman explains that compensatory funding has helped the Anoka-Hennepin School District improve student
                            performance and work toward the goal of all students achieving passing grades. He says the district used the
                            compensatory funding it received to invest in direct service to students and provide instructional coaching
                            with classroom teachers for young students. He argues, his bill isn’t about giving his district new dollars,
                            it’s about offering schools stable funding that has proven results.<br><br>
                
                            “Even with the additional dollars this bill would bring schools, Anoka-Hennepin is receiving $934 less per
                            pupil than a similar sized district. If we were to provide all districts with the same dollar amount per
                            child the state would be looking at an investment of $174 million. My bill is a fraction of this, but it’s a
                            really good step forward,” said Hoffman.<br><br>

            Sen. Hoffman supported a provision that authorized the Office of Higher Education to create a student loan
